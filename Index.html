<h1> Fast Food </h1>

<h2> Burgers </h2>
<p> Burgers is one of my favorite fast foods. They are so tasty and delicious. We either fry some on the grill at home, or buy it from fast food restaurants. Five Guys, Social Burger, and Elevation Burger. </p>
<br> 
<h2> Pizza </h2>
<p> Pizza I also love because I like the texture and the way the cheese spreads when you take a bite out of a slice. </p>
<br> 
<h2> Hot Dogs </h2> 
<p> I like hot dogs because they are kind of like burgers but shaped in a different way. </p>
<br>
<h1> And please welcome the finale! </h1> 
<h2> Ramen Noodles </h2> 
<p> I absolutely love Rame Noodles because they are noodles in soup like miso, or fish, or chicken. My mom read it somewhere that you can only eat ramen 2 times a week. </p>
